## About Me

Hello! I'm Kelly Lee, a junior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, pursuing a major in Statistics and Data Science with a minor in Computer Science.  With a passion for data and an  interest in uncovering insights through statistical analysis and machine learning, I am dedicated to applying my skills to solve real-world problems.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at PURE (Promoting Undergraduate Research in Engineering), where I work on data-driven research projects involving Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to predict the quality of cacao beans. This role has allowed me to various utilize advanced statistical techniques such as PCA/PLS and DAPC, and machine learning algorithms like kNN and SVM.

Previously, I interned as a Data Analysis Intern at ATLAS (Applied Technology for Learning) Internships, where I processed, cleaned, and analyzed data from social media platforms. I developed an RShiny application for dynamic data analysis and presented my findings to maximize social media engagement for UIUC faculty.

Beyond academics and internships, I am actively involved in extracurricular activities. I am a member of Psi Eta Mu, an information science raternity that fosters professional growth and networking opportunities. Additionally, I worked as a Strategy Team Developer for Illini SolarCar, I developed a real-time data monitoring app that optimized car performance during 3000 km solar car races.
