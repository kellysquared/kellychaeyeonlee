### **Objective**

This undergraduate research project aimed to analyze the spectral data of various chocolate samples to identify and classify their unique properties. This was done using multiple different techniques to create comprehensive models that predict and visualize the differences in chocolate types based on their spectral data.

### **Context**

The dataset for this project consists of spectral data from 40 chocolate samples. Each sample is identified by a unique identifier and classified into different shell types. The features of the dataset represent absorbance values measured at different wavenumbers. The absorbance values are recorded across 950 different wavenumbers, providing a detailed spectral profile for each sample. 

### Background

This project was conducted during while I was under PURE (Promoting Undergraduate in Research), a research program at the Univeristy of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. It aimed to explore the potential of Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy in the food industry, particularly in differentiating and classifying chocolate samples. The analysis focuses on understanding the chemical and physical properties of chocolate through its spectral data.

As an undergraduate research assistant, I was responsible for data preprocessing, performing various statistical analyses, and visualizing the results. The project involved collaborating with various student researchers as well my research team leader. 

### **Tools and Methodologies**

Data analysis was conducted using R for statistical computations and visualization. The methodologies included PCA, DAPC, k-NN, SVM, and Random Forest for analyzing and modeling the data.
