# **Project Overview**

### **Objective**

The primary objective of this project was to analyze and improve the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system for Synchrony by identifying and addressing areas with low resolution rates and high floor transfer rates. This was achieved through comprehensive data cleaning, exploration, and proposing actionable solutions to enhance the efficiency of the IVR system.

### **Context**

This project was conducted during the 2024 UIUC Datathon, where our team aimed to streamline Synchrony's IVR system. The project involved several key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Merging data frames, creating a `Timestamp_call_key`, and handling NaN values appropriately.
2. **Data Exploration**: Identifying call categories with low IVR resolution rates, analyzing caller demographics, and differentiating between reactive and proactive callers.
3. **Proposing Solutions**: Developing targeted strategies to improve IVR performance and reduce the number of calls transferred to live support.

### **Tools and Methodologies**

- **Python**: Used for data cleaning and merging data frames.
- **Data Analysis Techniques**: Identification of call categories, caller demographics, and system-wide evaluation.
- **Proposed Solutions**: Investigating retailers with high promotional balance callers and enhancing online alternatives for address/phone number changes.
